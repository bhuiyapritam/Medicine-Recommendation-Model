Personalised Medicine Recommendation and Disease Flagging Model Based on User's Previous Orders.

Description:-
Machine learning model flags the users with the diseases that they may have based on
analyzing their historical medicine order and recommend alternate related medicines and products. The model uses
a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The simulation results show that the model can
handle complex situations, such as multiple medications and medical conditions, and predict medication recommen-
dations with high accuracy.
